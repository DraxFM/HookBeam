### <a id="usage"></a> :toolbox: - Usage

1. Get any working Discord Webhook URL
2. Open **HookBeam** and select what you want to do
3. Either choose Single Use or Log into the Webhook (see [Modes](#modes) for more info)
4. Follow the instructions
5. The program will do the rest

---

### <a id="modes"></a> :link: - Modes
#### 1. Single-Use Functions
This will make HookBeam ask for your Webhook URL over and over again. This can be useful when working with multiple Webhooks.

---

#### 2. Log into Webhook
This will prevent HookBeam from asking for your Webhook URL multiple times but use the one you provided at the very beginning. This is very useful when only working with one Webhook as it spares a lot of time.
